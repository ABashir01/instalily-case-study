# Instalily Case Study

A take-home assignment that I completed for Instalily. Involved creating an AI chatbot for a appliance parts website.

## Description

The motivation for this was creating a smart shopping assistant that utilized a vector database to allow users to type what they need in normal language and be told the parts that might help them.

## Technologies Used
 - React.js
 - Python (Flask)
 - OpenAI API
 - Qdrant

### Executing program

* To run the backend, navigate to the backend directory, then run "python3 server.py" assuming you've installed the necessary dependencies (probably via pip)
* To run the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory, then run "npm run dev" if using npm after installing the necessary dependencies (probably via npm or yarn)
* The database_population.py file can also just be run like a normal python file (using 'python3 server.py')
